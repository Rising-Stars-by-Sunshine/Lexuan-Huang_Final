## Statement of Intellectual and Professional Growth

Engaging in this project has been an incredibly enriching experience. It has significantly enhanced our understanding of the intersection between machine learning and social sciences.

During the data collection and analysis phase, we honed our skills in handling large - scale datasets, learning how to clean, preprocess, and analyze data effectively. This hands - on experience has deepened our understanding of data - driven research methods.

In the model development process, we faced numerous challenges in selecting appropriate algorithms and optimizing model performance. Through iterative testing and troubleshooting, we not only improved our technical proficiency in machine learning but also learned the importance of critical thinking and perseverance.

Overall, this project has been a crucial stepping - stone in our intellectual and professional development, equipping us with the skills and knowledge necessary for future endeavors in this dynamic field.
